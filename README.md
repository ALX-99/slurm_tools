=====


This repo contains example SLURM scripts for
submitting to the cluster. Make sure to change
the email if you want to submit these scripts.
To submit to the cluster type:

sbatch SCRIPT_NAME.slurm

- example-1

This runs a few very simple commands, one with a single
process, and another few with multiple processes.
Demonstrates the use of srun.
