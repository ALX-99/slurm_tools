When I tried Intel's version of mpiexec,
I needed to run:

mpd &

first. After the job was complete, you 
can kills this daemon. This works from a 
gateway, but it does not work across multiple
compute nodes. Intel's version of mpiexc (or mpirun)
does not play nice with Torque...

I'm also having trouble getting mpi job to run
through Torque when built with intel's mpicxx
but run with mpiexec from:

https://www.osc.edu/~djohnson/mpiexec/

this is loaded through: setpkgs -a mpiexec

It runs but doesn't recognize the number of 
processors...it thinks there is just a single
processor. This happens when I use this version
of mpiexec against an openmpi_intel build as well.
However, if I use openmpi's version of mpiexec
the program runs correctly. grrrrrrrrrrrrr
